At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

## My version

* Since I'm doing this with Python 3, I figured I'd switch to [tdl](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tdl) over [libtcod](https://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod). There's a related tutorial [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python3%2Btdl).
* You might also notice that I'm almost seven weeks behind. I don't expect that to get better.
